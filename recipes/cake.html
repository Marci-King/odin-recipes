<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>200g butter</li>
  <li>200g caster sugar</li>
  <li>4 large eggs</li>
  <li>200g self-raising flour</li>
  <li>200g icing sugar</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter a 20 x 30cm cake tin and line
    with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat
    with an electric whisk for a few minutes until pale and fluffy. Add the
    eggs, flour, milk and vanilla and beat again until you have a smooth batter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Scrape the batter into the prepared tin, spread right to the corners and
    smooth the surface. Bake for 40-45 mins or until a skewer inserted into the
    centre comes out clean, checking at 5 min intervals if it isn't ready after
    45 mins. Leave the sponge to cool on a wire rack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix the icing sugar with enough water to make a thick icing. Spread the
    icing over the cooled cake, then top with lots of sprinkles â€“ the surface
    should be almost completely covered. Leave for at least 1 hr to set. Cut
    into squares and serve with hot custard, if you like.
  </li>
</ol>
